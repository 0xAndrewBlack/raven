"""Install the Visual C++ redistributables from 2005 to 2022, both widths, through Raven, alone and all together in one prefix.

Each package runs unmodified and silent, as Microsoft publishes it. A program built against the runtime it brings must then load that
runtime from where the package put it and run. Together, the packages go into one prefix oldest first or newest first; after each one
every program installed so far must still run, and at the end the older packages go in again over the newer ones.
